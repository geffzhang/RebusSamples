## PubSub

This sample demonstrates how a publisher can publish messages to two subscribers. 

The type-based router is used (which means that you subscribe/unsubscribe to specific message types) 
along with a local subscription storage (which means that the publisher stores subscriptions locally, 
and subscribers must subscribe by sending a `SubscribeRequest` to the publisher - this is what happens
underneath the covers when they `await bus.Subscribe`).

Make sure you start the publisher first, because it will need to create its own input queue. 

After having started the publisher once, you may run the publisher and the two subscribers in any
order, and still all events will be delivered.
